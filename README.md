## Overview

### The task

The task was to make a simple shop app. Requirements:

- App shows a list of products
- User can choose a product, and order it
- Order can be processed after the user provides an email address
- User can provide an optional promo code
- Promo code is valid, if it contains 2-8 digits, eg. code_123
- Discount is equal to the number of digits in code, eg. code_123 gives the user 3% discount

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Figma](https://figma.com/)

### What I learned

The greatest challenge here has been coding a shopping cart with a working promo codes mechanism. I am pretty sure I have managed to do it well. On top of that, I have decided it will be a good opportunity to prove my designer's skill. I have prepared the design using Figma.
